My Crash Game
My Crash Game is an Android game where you have to avoid crashing into the clouds into the witch. You can move your the witch left or right by tapping the buttons on the screen. The game gets faster and harder as you progress. How long can you survive?

This game was a project for my study. In the development, I used a timer, a vibrator, and a toast to create an engaging and challenging experience. This is an endless game, so try to beat your own high score!

Note: I did not use canvas and X Y coordinates to move the clouds in this game. Instead, I used a matrix of layouts and views to create the animation.

Usage
To play My Crash Game, tap the left or right button to move your hat. Avoid hitting the clouds and witches that fall from the sky. You have three lives, which are shown by the hats at the top of the screen. If you lose all your lives, the game is over.

Would you like to play 😊
