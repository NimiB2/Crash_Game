My Crash Game

My Crash Game is an Android game where you have to avoid crashing into the clouds. You can move your witch left or right by tapping the buttons on the screen or use sensors. You can choose the if the game gets faster and harder or take it easy. How long can you survive?

This game was a project for my study. In the development, I used a timer, a vibrator, and a toast to create an engaging and challenging experience.

Note: Constraints building the system was not use canvas and X Y coordinates to move the clouds in this game. Instead, I used a matrix of layouts and views to create the animation.

Features
Save data: The game keeps a list of the top 10 records in the game. You can see your rank and score on the main screen.
Google map: The game also records the location of each player who made it to the top 10. You can see a Google map with markers showing where the players played the game. You can zoom in and out of the map to explore the locations.
Sensor mode: You can choose to use buttons or the sensors to control the witch. If you choose the sensor mode, you can tilt your device left or right to move the witch.
Fast or slow: You can choose to play the game in fast or slow mode. The fast mode will make the game more difficult and exciting, while the slow mode will make the game easier and relaxing.
